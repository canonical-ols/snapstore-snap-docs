# Enterprise Store Reference

Our *Reference* section contains technical details (such as the Overrides API specs and
authentication mechanism), and other supplementary reference materials.

| **Reference**                               | How the Proxy works                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Overrides API](api-overrides.md)           | API specs for the Overrides API                                          |
| [API authentication](api-authentication.md) | API authentication for Proxy admins when using the Overrides API         |
| [Feature list](feature-list.md)             | A summarised list of features of the Proxy                               |
| [Product whitepaper](whitepaper.md)         | Whitepaper on managing snaps in an enterprise environment with the Proxy |
| [Cryptography](cryptography.md)             | An Outline of the usage of cryptographic technology                      |

Alternatively, our *Tutorials* section contain step-by-step tutorials to help outline
what the Proxy is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with the Enterprise Store,
our *How-to* guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to
a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but may require
you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Finally, for a better understanding of how the Enterprise Store works, our *Explanation*
section enables you to expand your knowledge.
