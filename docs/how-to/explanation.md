# Enterprise Store Explanation guides

Our explanatory and conceptual guides are written to provide a better understanding of
how the Enterprise Store works and how it can be used and configured. They enable you
to expand your knowledge and become better at using the Proxy.

| **Explanation guides** | Why it does what it does |

For a simpler place to start with the Proxy, our *Tutorials* section contains
step-by-step tutorials to outline what the Proxy is capable of while helping
you achieve specific aims.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with the Proxy, our *How-to*
guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set
of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end-result but may require you to understand
and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Take a look at our *Reference* section for technical details (such as the Overrides API
specs and authentication mechanism), and other supplementary reference materials.
