# Integrate a Dedicated Snap Store

Enterprise Stores are designed to work with Dedicated Snap Stores, with some limitations.
Support includes offline and proxy-restricted operations.

Supported functionality includes:

* Synchronisation of credentials and snaps from a Dedicated Snap Store
* Publication of snaps directly to the Enterprise Store
