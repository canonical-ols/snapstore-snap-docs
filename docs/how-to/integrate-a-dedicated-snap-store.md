# Integrate a Dedicated Snap Store

Dedicated Snap Stores can work with Enterprise Stores, with some limitations. Support includes
offline and proxy-restricted operations.

Supported functionality includes:

* Support for publisher snaps not available in the SaaS Store
* Publication of snaps to the Enterprise Store
