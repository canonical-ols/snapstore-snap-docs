# Enterprise Store How-to guides

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with the Enterprise Store,
our *How-to* guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to
a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but may require
you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.
