# Enterprise Store Reference

Our *Reference* section contains technical details (such as the Overrides API specs and
authentication mechanism), and other supplementary reference materials.

| **Reference**                               | How the Proxy works                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Overrides API](reference/api-overrides.md)           | API specs for the Overrides API                                          |
| [API authentication](reference/api-authentication.md) | API authentication for Proxy admins when using the Overrides API         |
| [Feature list](reference/feature-list.md)             | A summarised list of features of the Proxy                               |
| [Cryptography](reference/cryptography.md)             | An Outline of the usage of cryptographic technology                      |

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with the Enterprise Store,
our *How-to* guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to
a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but may require
you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.
